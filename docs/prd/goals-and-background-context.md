## Background Context

TaskFlow aims to address the pervasive issue of low user adoption and engagement in traditional task management tools by introducing a human-centric, reward-based system. Existing solutions often fail to recognize employee effort, leading to decreased motivation and productivity. TaskFlow seeks to transform work into a more rewarding experience through gamification elements like badges and enterprise incentives, fostering a positive feedback loop where engaged employees are more productive. The initial focus is on tech-forward project teams who struggle with alignment and motivation in collaborative environments.
