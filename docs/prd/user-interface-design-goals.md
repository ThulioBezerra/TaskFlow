# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The overall UX vision for TaskFlow is to create a visually appealing, intuitive, and engaging experience that makes task management feel rewarding rather than a chore. The design should be clean, modern, and user-friendly, minimizing cognitive load and maximizing user satisfaction. The gamification elements (badges, animations) should be seamlessly integrated to enhance motivation without being distracting or childish.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

TaskFlow will primarily utilize a Kanban-style drag-and-drop interface for task management, allowing for fluid and responsive interactions. Key interactions will focus on ease of task creation, assignment, status updates, and project navigation. Real-time updates will be a core interaction paradigm to support collaborative environments.

## Core Screens and Views

*   Login Screen
*   Registration Screen
*   Main Dashboard (displaying projects and tasks)
*   Kanban Board View (for task management within a project)
*   Task Detail Page (for viewing/editing individual task details, comments, attachments)
*   Project Settings Page (for managing project members and details)
*   User Profile Page (displaying earned badges)

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

## Branding

The branding should convey a sense of modern professionalism combined with an approachable, positive, and rewarding aesthetic. While specific brand guidelines are not yet defined, the visual design should support the "human and rewarding" value proposition. This might involve a vibrant but not overwhelming color palette, clear typography, and subtle animations for gamification feedback.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

## MVP Feedback and Validation Plan

To ensure the MVP meets user needs and effectively validates our core assumptions, we will implement a multi-faceted feedback strategy:

*   **Qualitative Feedback:** We will conduct structured user interviews with a cohort of 5-10 early adopter teams. These sessions will focus on usability, the perceived value of the gamification features, and identifying major pain points.
*   **Quantitative Feedback:**
    *   **In-App Surveys:** A simple, non-intrusive survey will be deployed in-app to measure Net Promoter Score (NPS) and gather targeted feedback on specific features.
    *   **Analytics:** We will track key user behaviors, such as feature adoption rates (especially for badges), task completion velocity, and daily/monthly active usage to quantitatively assess engagement.
*   **Feedback Loop:** All feedback will be centralized and regularly reviewed by the product team. This data will be the primary driver for prioritizing the post-MVP roadmap, ensuring our development efforts are directly aligned with user needs and market demand.
