# Branding & Style Guide

This section outlines the visual identity and style guidelines for TaskFlow, ensuring a consistent and cohesive brand experience across the application. While formal brand guidelines are still evolving, this document will establish the foundational elements.

### Visual Identity

**Brand Guidelines:** The overall visual identity for TaskFlow will convey **modern professionalism combined with an approachable, positive, and rewarding aesthetic**. The design will support the "human and rewarding" value proposition, integrating gamification elements subtly to enhance motivation without distraction.

### Color Palette

Given the use of Material-UI, we will define a custom color palette that aligns with the brand's aesthetic. This will involve selecting primary, secondary, and accent colors, along with semantic colors for success, warning, and error states, and a range of neutral colors for text and backgrounds.

| Color Type | Hex Code | Usage |
| :--------- | :------- | :---- |
| Primary    | `{{primary_color}}` | `{{primary_usage}}` (e.g., main interactive elements, branding) |
| Secondary  | `{{secondary_color}}` | `{{secondary_usage}}` (e.g., complementary actions, secondary branding) |
| Accent     | `{{accent_color}}` | `{{accent_usage}}` (e.g., gamification highlights, calls to action) |
| Success    | `#4CAF50` | Positive feedback, confirmations |
| Warning    | `#FFC107` | Cautions, important notices |
| Error      | `#F44336` | Errors, destructive actions |
| Neutral    | `{{neutral_colors}}` | Text, borders, backgrounds (e.g., shades of grey) |

### Typography

We will select font families and define a type scale to ensure readability and visual hierarchy.

#### Font Families

*   **Primary:** `{{primary_font}}` (e.g., a modern sans-serif for headings and body text)
*   **Secondary:** `{{secondary_font}}` (e.g., a complementary sans-serif or serif for specific elements)
*   **Monospace:** `{{mono_font}}` (e.g., for code snippets or technical information)

#### Type Scale

| Element | Size | Weight | Line Height |
| :------ | :--- | :----- | :---------- |
| H1      | `{{h1_size}}` | `{{h1_weight}}` | `{{h1_line}}` |
| H2      | `{{h2_size}}` | `{{h2_weight}}` | `{{h2_line}}` |
| H3      | `{{h3_size}}` | `{{h3_weight}}` | `{{h3_line}}` |
| Body    | `{{body_size}}` | `{{body_weight}}` | `{{body_line}}` |
| Small   | `{{small_size}}` | `{{small_weight}}` | `{{small_line}}` |

### Iconography

**Icon Library:** We will primarily use **Material Icons** (from Material-UI) to maintain consistency with the chosen component library.

**Usage Guidelines:** Icons will be used to enhance usability, provide visual cues, and support the gamification elements (e.g., badges). Consistency in size, style, and color will be maintained.

### Spacing & Layout

**Grid System:** We will utilize Material-UI's responsive `Grid` component for layout, providing a flexible and consistent spacing system.

**Spacing Scale:** A consistent spacing scale (e.g., based on an 8px or 4px grid) will be applied throughout the design to ensure visual harmony and alignment.
