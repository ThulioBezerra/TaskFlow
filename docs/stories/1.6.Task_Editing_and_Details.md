# Story 1.6: Task Editing and Details

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As an** authenticated user,
**I want** to edit a task's details, including its title, description, assignee, priority, and due date,
**so that** I can keep my tasks up-to-date.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Clicking on a task card opens a detailed view or modal.
2. From this view, the user can edit the title, description, priority, and due date.
3. The user can re-assign the task to another user in the project.
4. Changes are saved to the database upon submission.
5. The task card on the Kanban board reflects the updated information.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1 (Frontend - AC: 1): Implement the functionality to open a `TaskDetailsModal` when a `TaskCard` is clicked.
- [ ] Task 2 (Frontend - AC: 2, 3): Create the `TaskDetailsModal` component.
    - [ ] Subtask 2.1: The modal should display all task details.
    - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Include editable fields for title, description, priority, due date, and a dropdown for the assignee.
- [ ] Task 3 (Frontend - AC: 4, 5): On save, call the `updateTask` method in the `taskService` and update the local state to reflect the changes on the Kanban board.
- [ ] Task 4 (Backend - AC: 4): Enhance the `PUT /api/tasks/{id}` endpoint to allow updating all editable fields.
    - [ ] Subtask 4.1: Update the `UpdateTaskRequest` DTO to include all new fields.
    - [ ] Subtask 4.2: Extend the `updateTask` method in `TaskService` to handle the updates.

## Dev Notes

### Frontend
- **Component:** A `TaskDetailsModal` component is required. [Source: `docs/architecture/components.md`]
- **Data Flow:** When a task is updated, the local state for the Kanban board should be refreshed to show the new information.

### Backend
- **Endpoint:** The existing `PUT /api/tasks/{id}` endpoint will be modified to accept more fields for updates.
- **DTO:** The `UpdateTaskRequest` DTO will need to be expanded to include all the editable fields from the task.
