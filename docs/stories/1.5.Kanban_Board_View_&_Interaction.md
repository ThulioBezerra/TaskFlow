# Story 1.5: Kanban Board View & Interaction

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As an** authenticated user,
**I want** to see all my tasks on a Kanban board and move them between columns,
**so that** I can visualize and update my workflow in real-time.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A Kanban board view is available after login.
2. The board has three distinct columns: "To Do", "In Progress", and "Completed".
3. Tasks are displayed as cards within the column corresponding to their status.
4. Users can drag and drop a task card from one column to another.
5. Dropping a card in a new column updates the task's status in the backend in real-time.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1 (Frontend - AC: 1, 2, 3): Create the `KanbanBoard` component.
    - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Create `KanbanColumn` and `TaskCard` components.
    - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Fetch tasks for the project and render them in the correct columns based on their status.
- [ ] Task 2 (Frontend - AC: 4): Implement drag-and-drop functionality using a library like `dnd-kit`.
- [ ] Task 3 (Frontend - AC: 5): When a task is dropped in a new column, call the `taskService` to update its status.
- [ ] Task 4 (Backend - AC: 5): Implement the `PUT /api/tasks/{id}` endpoint to update the task status.
    - [ ] Subtask 4.1: The `TaskController` should have a method to handle this.
    - [ ] Subtask 4.2: The `TaskService` should contain the logic to update the task's status in the database.
- [ ] Task 5 (Optional - Real-time): Implement WebSocket logic to broadcast task updates to all connected clients.

## Dev Notes

### Frontend
- **Components:** This feature requires a `KanbanBoard`, `KanbanColumn`, and `TaskCard` component. [Source: `docs/architecture/components.md`]
- **Drag-and-Drop:** Use a library like `dnd-kit` as specified in the architecture. [Source: `docs/architecture/components.md`]
- **State Management:** The board will need to manage the state of tasks. Consider using `TanStack Query (React Query)` for server state. [Source: `docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md`]

### Backend
- **Endpoint:** `PUT /api/tasks/{id}`. This will be used to update the task status. [Source: `docs/architecture/api-specification.md`]
- **Real-time:** For an enhanced experience, consider broadcasting status updates via WebSockets. [Source: `docs/architecture/core-workflows.md`]
