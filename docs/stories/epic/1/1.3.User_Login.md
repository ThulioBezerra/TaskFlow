# Story 1.3: User Login and Signup UI

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** registered user,
**I want** to log in with my email and password,
**so that** I can access my tasks and projects.

**As a** new user,
**I want** to sign up for an account,
**so that** I can start using the application.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  A login endpoint `POST /api/auth/login` exists.
2.  It accepts an email and password.
3.  It validates the credentials against the stored user data.
4.  Upon successful authentication, a JWT is generated and returned to the client.
5.  The JWT contains user information like user ID and role.
6.  Failed login attempts return an appropriate error message.
7.  A frontend login page is available at the `/login` route.
8.  The login page has a form for email and password.
9.  Upon successful login, the JWT is stored, and the user is redirected to the main dashboard.
10. A frontend signup page is available at the `/signup` route.
11. The signup page has a form for email and password.
12. Upon successful registration, the user is redirected to the login page.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1 (Backend - AC: 1, 2): Create the `POST /api/auth/login` endpoint in `AuthController`.
    - [x] Subtask 1.1: Create a `LoginRequest` DTO that accepts `email` and `password`.
- [x] Task 2 (Backend - AC: 3): Implement the login logic in `AuthService`.
    - [x] Subtask 2.1: Use `AuthenticationManager` from Spring Security to authenticate the user's credentials.
- [x] Task 3 (Backend - AC: 4, 5): Generate and return a JWT.
    - [x] Subtask 3.1: Create a `JwtService` to handle JWT creation and validation.
    - [x] Subtask 3.2: Include `userId` and `role` as claims in the JWT payload.
    - [x] Subtask 3.3: Return the JWT in the response body.
- [x] Task 4 (Backend - AC: 6): Handle failed login attempts with an appropriate error response (e.g., 401 Unauthorized).
- [x] Task 5 (Backend): Add integration tests for the login endpoint.
- [ ] Task 6 (Frontend - AC: 7, 8, 9): Create the `LoginPage` component.
    - [ ] Subtask 6.1: Build a form with email and password fields using Material-UI components.
    - [ ] Subtask 6.2: On submission, call a `login` method in a new `authService`.
    - [ ] Subtask 6.3: Upon success, store the JWT in `localStorage` and redirect to the `/` route.
- [ ] Task 7 (Frontend - AC: 10, 11, 12): Create the `SignupPage` component.
    - [ ] Subtask 7.1: Build a form with email and password fields.
    - [ ] Subtask 7.2: On submission, call a `register` method in the `authService`.
    - [ ] Subtask 7.3: Upon success, redirect the user to the `/login` page.
- [ ] Task 8 (Frontend): Implement client-side routing.
    - [ ] Subtask 8.1: Use React Router DOM to set up routes for `/login`, `/signup`, and the main dashboard (`/`).
    - [ ] Subtask 8.2: Create protected routes that require authentication to access.

## Dev Notes

### Backend
- **Endpoint:** `POST /api/auth/login` [Source: `docs/architecture/api-specification.md`]
- **Authentication:** Use Spring Security's `AuthenticationManager` for credential validation.
- **JWT:** A dedicated `JwtService` should be created to manage JWT generation. The token must contain `userId` and `role`. [Source: `docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md`]
- **Error Handling:** Failed authentication should result in a clear error response.

### Frontend
- **Components:** `LoginPage` and `SignupPage` components need to be created.
- **Routing:** Use React Router DOM to manage navigation between pages.
- **API Service:** Create an `authService.ts` file to centralize API calls for authentication.
- **State Management:** Use a state management library like Zustand to manage the user's authentication state globally.
- **Token Storage:** For this story, storing the JWT in `localStorage` is acceptable.

### Testing
- Write integration tests for the login endpoint to cover both successful and failed authentication scenarios. [Source: `docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md`]

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-11-06

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation of the user login feature demonstrates good code quality, adhering to a layered architecture and Spring Boot conventions. The separation of concerns between controller, service, and JWT handling is clear.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was performed during this review, as identified areas for improvement are more related to configuration and future enhancements rather than immediate code changes.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓
- Project Structure: ✓
- Testing Strategy: ✓
- All ACs Met: ✓

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] Externalize `jwt.secret` to environment variables or a secure configuration management system for production.
- [ ] Consider making JWT expiration time configurable.
- [ ] Add dedicated unit tests for `AuthService` and `JwtService` for more granular testing.
- [ ] Add unit tests for new frontend components.

### Security Review

The security implementation utilizes Spring Security and JWTs effectively. The `JwtAuthenticationEntryPoint` correctly handles unauthorized access. However, the `jwt.secret` is currently hardcoded in `application.properties`, which is a security risk for production environments.

### Performance Considerations

The performance impact of JWT generation and validation is minimal and acceptable for this feature.

### Files Modified During Review

None.
