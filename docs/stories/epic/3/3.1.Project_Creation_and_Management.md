# Story 3.1: Project Creation and Management

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As an** authenticated user,
**I want** to create new projects with a name, description, and team members,
**so that** I can organize my tasks into distinct workstreams.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A "Create Project" option is available in the application.
2. The project creation form requires a project name and allows for a description.
3. The user creating the project is automatically assigned as a 'Manager' or 'Administrator' for that project.
4. Users can invite other registered users to join the project as 'Collaborators'.
5. Project details (name, description, members) can be viewed and edited by authorized users.
6. Projects are persisted to the database.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1 (Frontend - AC: 1, 2): Implement a `CreateProjectModal` component.
- [ ] Task 2 (Frontend - AC: 4): Add functionality to the `CreateProjectModal` to search for and add existing users to the project.
- [ ] Task 3 (Frontend - AC: 5): Implement a `ProjectSettingsPage` where project details can be viewed and edited.
- [ ] Task 4 (Backend - AC: 2, 3, 6): Implement the `POST /api/projects` endpoint.
    - [ ] Subtask 4.1: Create a `ProjectService` to handle the business logic for project creation.
    - [ ] Subtask 4.2: The service should associate the creating user as a manager.
- [ ] Task 5 (Backend - AC: 4): Implement functionality in the `ProjectService` to add members to a project.
- [ ] Task 6 (Backend - AC: 5): Implement the `PUT /api/projects/{projectId}` endpoint for updating project details.
- [ ] Task 7 (Backend): Implement the `GET /api/projects` and `GET /api/projects/{projectId}` endpoints.

## Dev Notes

### Frontend
- **Component:** A `CreateProjectModal` and a `ProjectSettingsPage` will be required. [Source: `docs/architecture/components.md`]
- **State Management:** A global store (e.g., Zustand) might be useful for managing the list of projects. [Source: `docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md`]

### Backend
- **Endpoint:** New endpoints under `/api/projects` are required for creating, updating, and retrieving projects. [Source: `docs/architecture/api-specification.md`]
- **Service Logic:** A `ProjectService` will be created to manage project-related business logic. [Source: `docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md`]
- **Data Model:** The `Project` entity will be used, which has a many-to-many relationship with the `User` entity. [Source: `docs/architecture/data-models.md`]

### Testing
- **Backend:** Integration tests for the `ProjectController` (once created) and unit tests for the `ProjectService` are needed. [Source: `docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md`]
- **Frontend:** Component tests for the new modal and page, as well as integration tests for the project creation and editing flows, should be written. [Source: `docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md`]
