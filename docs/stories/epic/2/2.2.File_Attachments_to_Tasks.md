# Story 2.2: File Attachments to Tasks

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As an** authenticated user,
**I want** to attach files to tasks via drag and drop,
**so that** I can provide relevant documents or resources for the task.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The task detail view includes an area for file attachments.
2. Users can drag and drop files onto this area to upload them.
3. Uploaded files are associated with the task and stored securely.
4. Attached files are listed in the task detail view, with options to download them.
5. The system handles common file types (e.g., images, PDFs, documents).

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1 (Frontend - AC: 1, 4): Implement an `AttachmentsSection` component within the `TaskDetailsModal`.
    - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Display existing attachments, showing file name and a download link/button.
- [ ] Task 2 (Frontend - AC: 2, 5): Implement a drag-and-drop file upload zone.
    - [ ] Subtask 2.1: On file drop, call an `uploadAttachmentToTask` method in the `taskService`.
    - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Update the local state to display the new attachment immediately.
- [ ] Task 3 (Backend - AC: 3, 5): Implement the `POST /api/tasks/{taskId}/attachments` endpoint for file uploads.
    - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Create an `AttachmentService` to handle file storage and association with tasks.
    - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Store the file in a designated local storage location (for MVP) and save its metadata (file name, URL, type) to the database.

## Dev Notes

### Frontend
- **Component:** An `AttachmentsSection` component will be needed within the `TaskDetailsModal`. A drag-and-drop library can be used to facilitate the upload UI. [Source: `docs/architecture/components.md`]
- **Data Flow:** After a file is uploaded, the list of attachments should be refreshed to show the new file. [Source: `docs/architecture/core-workflows.md`]

### Backend
- **Endpoint:** A new `POST /api/tasks/{taskId}/attachments` endpoint is required. This will be a multipart request. [Source: `docs/architecture/api-specification.md`]
- **Service Logic:** An `AttachmentService` will be responsible for handling file uploads and managing attachment metadata. [Source: `docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md`]
- **Data Model:** The `Attachment` entity will be used. It has a relationship with `Task`. [Source: `docs/architecture/data-models.md`]
- **File Storage:** For the MVP, files will be stored on the local filesystem. This will need to be replaced with a cloud storage solution (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage) for production. [Source: `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`]

### Testing
- **Backend:** Integration tests for the `AttachmentController` (once created) and unit tests for the `AttachmentService` should be written, covering file upload and metadata persistence. [Source: `docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md`]
- **Frontend:** Component tests for the `AttachmentsSection` and integration tests for uploading and displaying attachments should be created. [Source: `docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md`]
